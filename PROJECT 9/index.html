        <h2>JAMIE FLOYD: <em>UPPER WEST SIDE CLASSIC 6</em></h2><br>
        <p>
          "Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an
          eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for
          anyone. It is CRAZY. But we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray
          Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"

        <p>
          "Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are
          great, neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet
          before we know it, there will be another "Everybody loves Raymond,"
          but on HGTV or TLC!"

        <h2>DAVID SIEGEL: <em>DOUBLED THE VALUE</em></h2><br>
        <p>
          "Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a
          pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his
          gut renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make
          home improvements."
